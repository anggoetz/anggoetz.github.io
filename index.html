<p>I’m a researcher, passionate about understanding how humans think about, and are impacted by, digital technologies.</p>
		
<p>Currently, I work at the <b>Max Planck Institute for Software Systems</b>, advised by Dr. Elissa M. Redmiles. I have led and assisted projects that investigate:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How digital content creators perform their labor, and how they think about the digital platforms and tools they use</li>
  <li>How users feel about (harmful) ads they are exposed to on social media</li>
  <li>Data privacy sentiment changes throughout the COVID-19 pandemic</li>
  <li>TikTok usage metrics using user donated data</li>
</ul>

<p>Previously, I worked as a <b>market researcher based in Los Angeles</b>, where I conducted qualitative interviews and basic quantitative analysis of survey data to help entertainment and tech companies understand their audiences.</p>

<p>I earned my <b>BA in both Communication and Sociology from UCSB</b> in 2019. I completed an honors thesis studying the relationship between human memory and the ability to save information on personal devices. I also aided my professors with projects on internet access and cognitive self-esteem, and personal closeness on social media.</p>
		
<p>I am currently based in Saarbrücken, where I am exploring German beer culture and taking advantage of Europe’s amazing railways and public transportation systems!</p>
