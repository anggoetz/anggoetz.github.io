<p>I am passionate about understanding how humans think about, and are impacted by, digital technologies.</p>
		
<p>Currently, I am a Research Masters student of Quantitative Social Sciences, and a graduate teaching assistant of Computational Social Science, at the <b>University of Amsterdam</b>.</p>

<p>Previously, I worked at the <b>Max Planck Institute for Software Systems</b>, advised by Dr. Elissa M. Redmiles. I have led and assisted on projects that investigate:</p>

<ul style="PADDING-LEFT: 12px">
  <li>How digital content creators perform their labor, and how they think about the platforms and tools they use</li>
  <li>How users feel about (harmful) ads they are exposed to on social media</li>
  <li>Data privacy sentiment changes throughout the COVID-19 pandemic</li>
  <li>TikTok usage metrics using user donated data</li>
</ul>

<p>I also worked as a <b>market researcher based in Los Angeles</b>, where I conducted qualitative interviews and quantitative analysis of survey data to help entertainment and tech companies understand their audiences.</p>

<p>I earned my <b>BA in both Communication and Sociology from UCSB</b> in 2019. I completed an honors thesis and worked as a research assistant on several projects pertaining to use of digital technologies and cognitive and behavioral outcomes.</p>
		
<p>I am currently based in the Netherlands, where I am enjoying exploring more of Europe via bicycle!</p>
