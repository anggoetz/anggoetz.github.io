<h2 id="features">Hello!</h2>

<p>Hello! I’m a researcher, passionate about understanding how humans think about technology and how they are impacted by technology.</p>
		
<p>Currently, I work at the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems, advised by Dr. Elissa Redmiles. I have led and assisted projects that investigate:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How digital content creators perform their labor, and how they think about the digital platforms and tools they use</li>
  <li>How users feel about (harmful) ads they are exposed to on social media</li>
  <li>Data privacy sentiment changes throughout the COVID-19 pandemic</li>
  <li>Responsive – works perfectly on all devices</li>
  <li>TikTok usage metrics using user donated data</li>
</ul>

<p>Previously, I worked as a market researcher based in Los Angeles, where I conducted qualitative interviews and basic quantitative analysis of survey data to help entertainment and tech companies understand their audiences.</p>

<p>I earned my BA in both Communication and Sociology from UCSB in 2019. I completed an honors thesis studying the relationship between human memory and the ability to save interesting information on personal devices. I also aided my professors with projects about how access to the internet may interact with cognitive self esteem, and how social media groups may interact with closeness with peers. Among other activities, I also worked as a graphic designer throughout college.</p>
		
<p>I am currently based in Saarbrücken, where I am discovering German beer culture and taking advantage of Europe’s amazing railways and public transportation systems!</p>
